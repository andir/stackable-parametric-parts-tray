# FreeCAD Parametric Parts Tray

![30x30x20](/images/stacked-30x30x20.png)


A simple (~10min) design of a parts tray. I wasn't really happy with existing designs. I wanted at least two or three differente sizes so I quickly sketched one out in FreeCAD.

The design is fully parametric. Edit the `Spreadsheet` within the FreeCAD project to change dimensions.

The dimensions of each cabinet in the [STEP file](./step/30x30x20-v1.step) are:
   * Width/Depth: 30mm (bottom)
   * Height: 20mm
   * Wall thickness: 2mm

This turned out to be pretty rigid even with the 50% scaled version (in the picture above).
